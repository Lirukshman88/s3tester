If you don't want to build from source you can download the compiled version of s3tester for Windows or Linux from [github.com/s3tester/s3tester/releases](https://www.github.com/s3tester/s3tester/releases)

## Usage

### Setting your S3 credentials

There are multiple options for setting credentials.

- Using environment Variables:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAINZFCN46TISVUUCA
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=VInXxOfGtEIwVck4AdtUDavmJf/qt3jaJEAvSKZO
```

- Using AWS credential file: see the `--profile` option below for details.

### Command line options

| Parameter | Type  | Note  |
| :---   | :---: | :--- |
| bucket | string | Bucket name (mandatory). Default: `test` |
| concurrency | int | Maximum concurrent requests. `0`: scan concurrency, run with `ulimit -n 16384`. Default: `1` |
| consistency | string | The StorageGRID consistency control to use for all requests. Does nothing against non StorageGRID systems. (`all`, `available`, `strong-global`, `strong-site`, `read-after-new-write`, `weak`) | 
| cpuprofile | string | Write CPU profile to file |
| days | int | The number of days that the restored object will be available for. Default: `1` |
| duration | int | Test duration in seconds. Mutually exclusive with `requests` |
| endpoint | string | target endpoint(s). If multiple endpoints are specified separate them with a `,`. Note: the concurrency must be a multiple of the number of endpoints. Default: `"https://127.0.0.1:18082"` |
| json | - | The result will be printed out in JSON format if this flag exists |
| lockstep | - | Force all threads to advance at the same rate rather than run independently |
| logdetail | string | Write detailed log to file |
| loglatency | string | Write latency histogram to file | 
| metadata  | string | Tthe metadata to use for the objects. The string must be formatted as such: `'key1=value1&key2=value2'`. Used for `put`, `updatemeta`, `multipartput`, `putget` and `putget9010r` |
| no-sign-request | - | Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument is provided |
| operation | string | Operation type: `put`, `multipartput`, `get`, `puttagging`, `updatemeta`, `randget`, `delete`, `options`, `head`, `restore`. Default: `put`
| overwrite | int | Turns a PUT/GET/HEAD into an operation on the same S3 key. `1`: all writes/reads are to same object, `2`: threads clobber each other but each write/read is to unique objects | 
| partsize | int | Size of each part in bytes. Only has an effect when a multipart put is used. Min: `5242880` (5MiB). Default: `5242880` (5MiB)|
| prefix | string | Object name prefix. Default: `testobject` |
| profile | string | Use a specific profile from [AWS CLI credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) |
| range | string | Specify range header for GET requests |
| ratelimit | float | The total number of operations per second across all threads. Default: `1.7976931348623157e+308` | 
| region | string | Region to send requests to. Default: `us-east-1` |
| repeat | int | Repeat each S3 operation this many times: Default: `0` (do not repeat) |
| requests | int | Total number of requests. Mutually exclusive with `duration`. Default: `1000` |
| retrysleep | int | How long to sleep in between each retry in milliseconds. Default: `0` (exponential backoff) |
| rr | - | Reduced redundancy storage for PUT requests | 
| size | int | Object size in bytes. Note that s3tester is not ideal for very large objects as the entire body must be read for v4 signing and the AWS SDK does not support v4 chunked. Performance may degrade as size increases due to the use of v4 signing without chunked support. Default: `30720` |
| tagging | string | The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be formatted as such: `'tag1=value1&tage2=value2'`. Used for `put`, `puttagging`, `putget` and `putget9010r` |
| tier | string | The retrieval option for restoring an object. One of `expedited`, `standard`, or `bulk`. AWS default option is standard if not specified. Default: `standard` |
| uniformDist | string | Generates a uniform distribution of object sizes given a min-max size. Allowed values: `10` to `20`) |
| verify | int | Verify the retrieved data on a get operation. `0`: disable verify (default); `1`: normal put data, `2`: multipart put data. If verify equals `2`, partsize is required (default `partsize` is `5242880` bytes) |
| workload | string | Filepath to JSON either a replay file generated by the auditAnalysis tool to play an exact workload on a grid or a `mixedWorkload` JSON file which allows a user to specify a mixture of operations. A sample mixed workload file must be in the format provided below the table |

#### mixedWorkload JSON Sample File

```raw
{
	"mixedWorkload": [{
		"operation": "put",
		"ratio": 25
	}, {
		"operationType": "get",
		"ratio": 25
	}, {
		"operationType": "updatemeta",
		"ratio": 25
	}, {
		"operationType": "delete",
		"ratio": 25
	}]
}
```

**NOTE:** The order of operations specified will generate the requests in the same order. That is, if you have DELETE followed by a PUT, but no objects on your grid to delete, all your deletes will fail.

## Exit codes

- `1`: one or more requests has failed

## Examples

### Writing objects into a bucket

```raw
./s3tester -concurrency=128 -size=20000000 -operation=put -requests=20000 -endpoint="https://10.96.105.5:18443" -prefix=3
```

- Starts writing objects into the default bucket `test`.
- The bucket needs to be created from the Tenant Admin CLI or otherwise prior to running s3tester.
- The naming of the ingested objects will be `3-object#` where `3` is the prefix specified and `object#` is a sequential number starting from zero and going to the number of requests.
- This command will perform a total of 20,000 PUT requests (or in this case slightly less because 20,000 does not divide by 128).
- The object size is 20,000,000 bytes.
- Replace the sample IP/port combination with the one you are using.

### Reading objects from a bucket (and other operations)

```raw
./s3tester -concurrency=128 -operation=get -requests=200000 -endpoint="https://10.96.105.5:18443" -prefix=3
```

- Matches the request above and will read the same objects written in the same sequence.
- If you use the `randget` operation the objects will be read in random order simulating a random-access workload.
- If you use the `head` operation then the S3 HEAD operation will be performed against the objects in sequence.
- If you use the `delete` operation then the objects will be deleted.

As of version 2.1.0 the concurrency on a retrieval operation can be different from the concurrency used to ingest the objects. The goal is to save time by ingesting data once and retrieving at different concurrencies to observe the impact on performance. However, the number of requests has to match the number that was actually ingested. For example, if we ingest with concurrency 1000 and requests set to 1100 then only 1000 requests will actually be ingested (1100 - 1100%1000) to keep the number of requests per client thread equal. Now when performing the retrieval the number of requests specified must be 1000, not 1100.

```

- `Nominal requests/s` is calculated ignoring any client side overheads.  This number will always be higher than actual requests/s.  If those two numbers diverge significantly it can be an indication that the client machine isn't capable of generating the required workload and you may want to consider using multiple machines.
- `Actual requests/s` is the total number of requests divided by the total elapsed time in seconds.
- `Content throughtput` is the total amount of data ingested and retrieved in MB divided by the total elapsed time in seconds.
- `Total number of unique objects` is the total number of unique objects being operated on successfully.

For per request details, s3tester can be run with the `-logdetail` option for capturing all the request latencies into a `.csv` file.
